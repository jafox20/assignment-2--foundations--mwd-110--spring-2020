      <h2>Education</h2>
      <P>I am a senior Audio Engineering Major at the University of Hartford. Currently pursuing a minor in <a href="https://catalog.hartford.edu/preview_program.php?catoid=23&poid=5119">Digital Media Technology.</a> My primary focus while attending the University of Hartford has been audio mixing and recording. However, my interest has led me towards content creating across multiple media sources. </P>
      <h2>Music</h2>
      <p>I also create music under the moniker "KNoWTe." I have been recording, performing and writing music for the past 6 years. My musical genre, I believe ranges, however it primarily stays in the realm of Hip-Hop. Click <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/7yW4oHXEk2GZZZHYYxlsA5">here</a> to listen!</p>
